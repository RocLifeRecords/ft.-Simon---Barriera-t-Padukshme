# ft.-Simon---Barriera-t-Padukshme
Project song
Barriera t'Padukshme is the thirteen single by Albanian Pop/Rap singer DenyD. It was released in Albania on 12 September 2017, by Netlabel DenyD District.

Background

DenyD wrote this song about some obstacles that can be described as invisible and meet every day. The song is used in this way, because on the other hand when work patterns are not favored, communication is blocked by obstacles and continues testing. 
Buildings play an important artistic role in the concept of song that is solid complex with a strong language. 
The song deals with social and emotional barriers imposed by individuals from society and also with what individually imposes on oneself. The song does not give in one-way communication with each other and for this reason, the first two minutes are empty. Therefore, the empty entry of the song shows the failure of a healthy relationship with one another due to lack of love among them. This failure is attributed to the surrounding nature that does not allow healthy relationships to grow and advance.
